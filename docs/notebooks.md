# Create a notebook with MyST Markdown

MyST Markdown notebooks are defined by two things:

1. YAML metadata that is needed to understand if / how it should convert text files to notebooks (including information about the kernel needed).
   See the YAML at the top of this page for example.
2. The presence of `{code-cell}` directives, which will be executed with your book.

That's all that is needed to get started!

## Quickly add YAML metadata for MyST Notebooks

If you have a markdown file and you'd like to quickly add YAML metadata to it, so that Jupyter Book will treat it as a MyST Markdown Notebook, run the following command:

```
jupyter-book myst init path/to/markdownfile.md
```
