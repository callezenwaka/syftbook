# Overview

This section contains cross-referenced tutorial material for foundational computing skills that one needs in order to work effectively with the open-source Scientific Python stack.

Differential privacy is a technique used to protect the privacy of individuals in a dataset. It is a mathematical framework that provides strong privacy guarantees while still allowing useful analysis of the data. OpenMined is an open-source stack that provides secure and private data science in Python. It decouples private data from model training using techniques such as federated learning, differential privacy, and encrypted computation. OpenMined's PyDP library provides an easy-to-use interface for working with differential privacy in Python.

To learn more about differential privacy, you can visit the [OpenMined Blog](https://blog.openmined.org/privacy-series-basics-definition/) or the [PyDP documentation](https://openmined.github.io/PyDP/introduction.html). To get started with OpenMined and PyDP, you can visit the [OpenMined website](https://www.openmined.org/) or the [PyDP GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP).

I hope this helps!
