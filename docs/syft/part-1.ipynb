    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## PySyft: Mailbox for Code\n",
    "What _is_ PySyft?\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to understand PySyft is to think of it as a mailbox for code. PySyft is a framework that allows a data scientist to submit their analysis code to a data owner. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Owners, who have large amounts of private data, as well as the infrastructure to work with it, can then assess the submitted code for privacy, security, IP and legal adherence, and if they approve it, can execute it within their own controlled environment. This ensures that sensitive data remains protected and isolated while generating valuable insights. After analysis, the Data Owner securely shares the results back with the data scientist through PySyft.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can scale quite well:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single data scientist can submit the same piece of code to several data owners.\n",
    "    - For example, think of each data owner representing all the data owned by a hopsital about a particular type of cancer. The data scientist could then train their ML model on cancer data that's stored in hospitals in various countries all over the world, while not requiring any of them to publicly disclose any information.\n",
    "- A data scientist can also ask for the same piece of code to be run multiple times against a single data owner's data.\n",
    "    - Imagine if the data scientist is trying to train a neural network on a data owner's data, and needs to train for multiple epochs on a single dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Working with PySyft\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with PySyft is quite simple, and for a Data Scientist, usually involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find a Domain Node with data you want to work on\n",
    "- Create an Account or Login to that Domain Node\n",
    "- Inspect the Datasets on that domain node\n",
    "- Create some analysis you'd like to run on the data\n",
    "    - You can use any Python library you're already familiar with- NumPy, PyTorch, JAX, and so on!\n",
    "- Submit your code to the domain node\n",
    "\n",
    "... and after that, you'd either get the result of your analysis back, or you'd get feedback from the data owner about any RunTime Errors or other feedback they have for you. Simple as that!\n",

    "# Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can start using PySyft, you have to install it. This is fairly straightforward, and we have cross platform support across Linux, MacOS, and Windows! [TODO: Add link to GitHub showing current support status?]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before we begin:** \n",
    "- This version of PySyft (0.8.2) requries Python 3.9-3.11. Steps on how to install Python can be found here at the Official Python documentation website [here.](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)\n",
    "- Before installing Syft, it would be helpful to have a VirtualEnvironment in order to isolate the Syft library and its dependencies from other parts of your system. A helpful primer on Virtual Environments can be found [here](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
